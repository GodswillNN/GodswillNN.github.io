      <h2>What is a “now page”?</h2>

      <p>Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that
        tells you something about the background of this person or business. For
        short, people just call it an “about page”.</p>

      <p>Most websites have a link that says “contact”. It goes to a page that
        tells you how to contact this person or business. For short, people just
        call it a “contact page”.</p>

      <p>So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you
        what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short,
        we call it a “now page”.</p>
